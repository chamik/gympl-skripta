== William Shakespeare 

William Shakespeare, often regarded as the greatest playwright in the English language, lived during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Here's a brief historical background of Shakespeare and the time in which he lived:

1. Elizabethan England (1558-1603): Shakespeare was born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. This was a time of great cultural flourishing in England, known as the Elizabethan era. It was marked by exploration, artistic achievement, and the rise of English nationalism.
2. Theater and Society: Theater was a popular form of entertainment in Elizabethan England, and it played a significant role in society. Plays were performed in public theaters, such as The Globe, where audiences from all social classes could attend.
3. Renaissance: Shakespeare lived during the Renaissance, a period of intellectual and cultural rebirth that spread across Europe. This era saw a renewed interest in classical learning, literature, and the arts.
4. Political Climate: England during Shakespeare's time was marked by political intrigue, religious conflict, and social change. Queen Elizabeth's reign was relatively stable, but there were tensions between Catholics and Protestants, as well as power struggles within the royal court.
5. Literary Influence: Shakespeare was influenced by classical literature, particularly the works of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as Ovid, Seneca, and Plutarch. He also drew inspiration from contemporary English poets and playwrights.
6. Shakespeare's Career: Shakespeare began his career as an actor and playwright in London, where he quickly gained recognition for his talent. He wrote and staged numerous plays, including tragedies like "Hamlet" and "Macbeth," comedies like "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Twelfth Night," and histories like "Henry IV" and "Richard III."
7. Legacy: Shakespeare's works have had a profound and enduring impact on literature, theater, and the English language. His plays continue to be performed worldwide, and his words have become an integral part of the literary canon. Shakespeare's influence can be seen in countless adaptations, references, and homages in popular culture.

== Ernest Hemingway <hemingway>

_Ernest Hemingway_ (1899--1961) was an American novelist and journalist born in Illinois. His work influenced many authors of the 20th century. He enjoyed fishing and drinking a lot; both influences of his father.

He began his career as a journalist. The style guides of _The Kansas City Star_ influenced his later writing: _"Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative."_

When WWI happened he was rejected by the U.S. Army for poor eyesight. Instead he became an ambulance driver in Italy. (He was 18 at this time.) There he was seriously wounded by mortar fire, but still managed to help his peers. Later he had this to say: _"When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you ... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you."_ 

He fell in love with many women over the years; married and divorced a lot of them. 

Ernest worked as a war corresponded in WW2 and was awarded for that. This also influenced his work.

He liked hunting (Green hills of africa), fishing (old man... he wrote in when he was in Cuba) 

He was apart of the "Lost generation" -- wrote works such as _A Farewell to Arms_ (Sbohem armádo), or _For Whom the Bell Tolls_ (Komu zvoní hrana).

His most famous book is titled _The Old Man and the Sea_ (Stařec a Moře #underline[@starec[]]). For this book he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. #underline["A man can be destroyed, but not defeated"]

Hemingway killed himself with his fathers shotgun -- mental health issues.
